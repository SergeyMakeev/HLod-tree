# Frontier design contracts

This document states the behavioral invariants behind the public API. See the
[API guide](API.md) for usage, [API reference](API_REFERENCE.md) for exact
signatures, and [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for layout.

## 1. One real root

Every top-level instance owns exactly one permanent renderable node in the
TLAS. It is the root of the instance's LOD tree and is always a valid fallback.
The TLAS's internal BVH nodes are spatial acceleration only and never appear in
a frontier.

A one-node tree ends here. No separate hierarchy object, definition, mount, or
sentinel is allocated.

## 2. Serialized definitions have an implicit parent

Registered subtree bytes describe a reusable immutable descendant forest. Its
serialized index zero is an implementation anchor used for packed child ranges;
it is not a renderable node and is never returned. At runtime its direct
renderable nodes are children of the node on which the definition is mounted.

This is the only legal way to instantiate a subtree. A mount therefore always
has one valid renderable parent: either a TLAS root or a mountable node in
another placement.

## 3. Definitions form a DAG; placements form trees

A mountable `NodeDesc` stores only a structural promise that it will remain a
local leaf. The application chooses a registered definition handle and local
translation/uniform scale when it calls `mountSubtree()`. Many city nodes can
mount the same house handle; each call creates a separate placement, so every
top-level instance still owns an ordinary runtime tree.

The database stores no authored content graph or stable content key. Preventing
cycles in application assembly policy remains the content pipeline's
responsibility.

## 4. Immutable data and instance data

One registered serialized byte array permanently owns:

- preorder topology and subtree extents;
- wide child blocks and lane masks;
- application payloads;
- geometric errors;
- authored local bounds;
- mountable-node bits.

Each registered definition owns one readiness bit per renderable node. That bit
is shared across every placement of the definition. Runtime placements own
accumulated transforms, derived coverage, mounted-child links, content stamps,
and LRU state. Runtime deformation never rewrites the definition. Effective
bounds use a copy-on-write overlay scoped to the top-level instance and
placement.

## 5. Boundary invariants

Builder output and every mount boundary maintain:

1. parents precede descendants in packed order;
2. each subtree is a contiguous range;
3. a parent bound contains every local child bound;
4. effective error never increases below a parent;
5. a node has local children or a mounted child, never both;
6. a transformed mounted definition fits inside the shared authored bound of a
   definition node, or the current instance-local root bound of a TLAS root.

The runtime carries the parent's effective error ceiling as a per-placement
scalar. It does not modify shared error arrays.

## 6. Current selection and opt-in refinement

Selection returns one ordered current cut. It contains only ready definition
nodes plus permanent TLAS roots and has complete hierarchy coverage. By
default, complete ready descendants may replace an unavailable
threshold-target node; otherwise a ready parent remains selected.
`CurrentCutPolicy::PreferReadyAncestors` disables the descendant substitution
and permits only upward fallback, producing a smaller, coarser cut. This is the
meaning of the hole-free guarantee; it does not concern mesh seams or
rasterization.

Streaming analysis is a separate `computeFrontierRefinement()` call on the
same query. It resumes below the immediately preceding current result with the
retained camera and selection parameters, skips TLAS discovery, and emits
complete visible immediate-child covers in breadth-first order. Depth bounds
limit lookahead. The node bound is checked before committing a group, so a
result never truncates sibling coverage. Unlimited depth makes exhaustive work
explicit rather than part of every selection.

A missing mounted definition stops both selection and refinement at its
mountable parent; application metadata decides which definition handle to
request. Plain leaves emit directly. Interior and mountable nodes are decided
by projected geometric error. Frustum plane masks narrow as traversal
descends.

## 7. Readiness and coverage

Readiness means that every GPU resource required to dispatch one node's
`UserPayload` is available. It belongs to the node in its registered definition,
not to the payload value or placement. Every placement of that definition node
shares the bit. Equal payload values in other nodes are independent; an
integration may update them together when they identify one resource.

Each mounted node records only derived coverage and a covered-child count. A
node is covered when it is ready or its visible descendants provide
a complete ready cut. Changes propagate toward each affected mount root
incrementally. A fully ready mounted tree has a constant-time summary used to
select the lean traversal path.

Topology and readiness are independent. Mounting exposes finer known topology;
marking a node ready makes that definition node available in every placement.

## 8. Handle safety

Runtime slots are recycled. `SubtreeHandle`, `SubtreeInstanceHandle`,
`InstanceHandle`, and `NodeHandle` carry generations. A stale topology
completion cannot modify a replacement occupying the same numeric slot.

Expected asynchronous races are non-fatal:

- readiness completions retain a `NodeHandle`; stale completions are ignored
  rather than affecting a recycled placement;
- stale queries report absence;
- mounting below a parent collected during IO returns an invalid placement;
- unmounting/removing an already stale handle does nothing.

Incorrect live operations remain contract failures: invalid transform,
non-mountable parent, duplicate child, cross-instance bounds access, or bound
escape.

## 9. TLAS contracts

The TLAS stores conservative world bounds, contribution maxima, and layer-mask
summaries for live instances; exact instance state remains in the dense
instance arrays. It supports incremental insertion, removal, and grow-only
motion publication. Changed leaves enter a deduplicated repair queue;
`applyUpdates(maintenanceNodeBudget)` tightens at most that many nodes and
propagates shrinkage by queuing parents. Unprocessed nodes remain conservative.
Population drift, edit count, and current lane-area growth only set a topology-
rebuild recommendation. `optimize(OptimizationMode::TopologyOnly)` performs an
exact SpatialBins rebuild while preserving dense instance layout.
`optimize(OptimizationMode::TopologyAndLayout)` performs configured-quality
rebuild, compaction, and spatial reordering. Both modes retain public instance
ids.

Flat TLAS roots have specialized emission paths and never touch mounted-state
streams. Hierarchical roots may terminate directly before a local camera
transform when their projected error is acceptable.

## 10. Query ownership and reuse

All mutable read-side state belongs to `SpatialQuery`: camera damping, cache
records, traversal scratch, result storage, counters, and optional mount-usage
feedback. The database remains read-only during selection.

Reuse is exact for node membership. A cached record is valid only while:

- the query's conservative position/projection travel stays inside the
  measured decision margin;
- the threshold epoch matches;
- the top-level instance version matches;
- every recorded mounted-tree content stamp matches;
- no frustum-plane decision was required for the instance.

Compact encoded error magnitude can age within that proven interval, but its
above/below-threshold classification remains correct.

An admitted exact view can return from the two-entry whole-cut memo without a
hierarchy walk, but downstream iteration remains proportional to the returned
cut. A caller that knows every record is invalid should disable reuse so it
does not pay validation and recording around an unavoidable raw walk.

## 11. Collection

Mount retention is an application policy. A query records usage only when
explicitly enabled, and collection consumes only the queries selected by the
host. Cold mounted leaves older than the minimum age are removed from the LRU
tail until the placement budget is met. Removing a placement invalidates its
node handles but never changes the registered definition's readiness bits.

Definitions are not collected implicitly. The host releases them explicitly
after all placements are gone.

## 12. Complexity

| Operation | Expected cost |
|---|---:|
| build definition | O(nodes) |
| register definition | default: O(nodes + wide blocks) validation; `FRONTIER_VALIDATE_SUBTREES=0`: O(1) trusted registration |
| release unused definition | O(1), excluding allocator cost |
| mount | O(definition nodes) on its first mount; O(1) for later childless placements; the first nested child copies its owner's coverage state |
| unmount mounted tree | O(placements removed) |
| node readiness change | placements of one definition and ancestor paths until stable |
| submit bound change | O(1) |
| flush bound change | O(ancestor depth) until contained |
| insert/remove/move instance | O(TLAS depth), plus caller-budgeted repair |
| selection | output-sensitive TLAS plus surviving hierarchy work |
| cache hit | O(recorded output plus dependency validation) |

The complexity bounds describe scaling, not constants. Use
[BENCHMARKING.md](BENCHMARKING.md) to measure the complete current workflow,
including output consumption, on each target.
