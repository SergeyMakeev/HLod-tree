# Frontier API Guide

Frontier is a C++20 library that chooses which level-of-detail (LOD) nodes a
renderer should draw from a large dynamic scene. It owns the spatial index,
reusable hierarchy topology, and the rules that preserve a complete renderable
result while GPU resources and finer hierarchy stream. The application still
owns rendering, resource loading, payload interpretation, and the policy that
decides where finer hierarchy should be attached.

This guide introduces the system in the order an integration normally uses it.
The exhaustive type and function contracts are in
[API_REFERENCE.md](API_REFERENCE.md).

The normal entry points are:

```cpp
#include <frontier/builder.h>
#include <frontier/spatial_database.h>

using namespace frontier;
```

## 1. What Frontier provides

A conventional LOD system can choose one mesh for one object. Frontier makes
the same decision across an assembled hierarchy: a city can refine into blocks,
a block into reusable buildings, and a building into reusable detail trees.
Definitions are shared and placements are independent. When a selected node is
not ready, Frontier uses a complete ready descendant cut when one exists;
otherwise it falls back to the nearest ready ancestor. Either path preserves
coverage without leaving holes.

### The two spatial levels

A bounding-volume hierarchy (BVH) groups spatial bounds so a query can reject
many objects or nodes without testing each one. Frontier uses two logical
levels:

- The **top-level acceleration structure (TLAS)** is an internal BVH4 or BVH8
  in world space. It indexes independently movable top-level instances. Every
  TLAS leaf is also that instance's permanent, renderable fallback node.
- A **subtree definition** is an immutable local-space hierarchy registered
  once and mounted wherever it is needed. In conventional ray-tracing
  terminology this is the BLAS-like, or bottom-level, part of the system.
  Frontier calls it a subtree definition rather than a BLAS because definitions
  can be mounted recursively below other definitions instead of forming one
  fixed lower tree per object.

The resulting runtime shape is:

```text
world-space TLAS
`-- top-level instance / permanent renderable root
    `-- mounted subtree definition
        `-- mountable renderable node
            `-- another mounted subtree definition
```

The TLAS first finds visible top-level instances. Frontier then enters their
mounted local hierarchies only when their roots need finer LOD. This separation
keeps world movement out of shared local topology, lets many placements reuse
one definition, and makes a one-node object require no bottom-level hierarchy
at all.

Both levels use the build-wide `FRONTIER_BVH_WIDTH`. The CMake setting accepts
`AUTO`, `4`, or `8`; its `AUTO` default resolves the numeric preprocessor macro
to BVH8 for AVX2's eight-lane backend and BVH4 for four-lane SSE2/NEON (and for
forced scalar). An application can explicitly select `4` or `8` after profiling
its target content and hardware. Serialized subtree bytes record the selected
width and must be rebuilt when it changes.

For binaries that must run on SSE2-only x86/x64 processors, configure with
`-DFRONTIER_SSE2_ONLY=ON`. This overrides AVX2, makes `AUTO` choose BVH4, and
forces both Frontier's explicit intrinsics and compiler-generated code to the
SSE2 baseline. An explicit BVH8 build remains valid and uses two 128-bit SIMD
groups.

### Nodes, errors, and cuts

Each hierarchy node is a renderable representation of everything below it. Its
geometric error estimates how far that representation can deviate from finer
detail. A query projects that error into screen pixels and refines while it is
above `SelectionParams::threshold`.

A **frontier**, also called a **cut**, is the set selected by that process. No
selected node is an ancestor of another, and together the selected nodes cover
the visible scene. Selection produces the **current cut**, which is hole-free
and renderable with resources available now. Streaming code can separately ask
for a bounded forest of complete refinement groups below that cut.

**Hole-free** means complete hierarchy coverage: every visible region represented
by a selected parent remains represented either by that parent or by a complete
set of selected descendants. Frontier never drops a parent merely because some
children are ready; it refines only when ready descendants cover every visible
branch that the parent covered. This is a selection guarantee, not a claim about
geometric cracks between meshes, occlusion, or rasterization.

A node's `payload` is only an opaque application identifier. **Readiness** says
whether the renderer can dispatch that node's payload; it does not mean that
finer topology has been mounted. When a desired node is not ready, the current
cut remains at a ready ancestor or uses a complete set of ready descendants.

Importantly, readiness is not required at every level of the hierarchy. An
unavailable ancestor does not block its descendants: if those descendants form
a complete ready cut, Frontier can render them directly. It falls back upward
only when descendant readiness is incomplete.

With that model, the smallest useful scene needs only a permanent top-level
node:

```cpp
SpatialDatabase database;

InstanceHandle rock = database.instantiate(
    NodeDesc{
        .payload = 1001,              // application resource/data id
        .geometricError = 0.0f,       // no finer representation
        .bounds = rockLocalBounds,
    },
    InstanceDesc{
        .pos = float4::point(40.0f, 0.0f, -12.0f),
        .scale = 1.0f,
        .mask = ~0u,
    });

database.applyUpdates(256);

SpatialQuery query;
Camera camera = makeLookAtCamera(cameraPosition, cameraTarget);
FrontierResultView cut = query.selectFrontier(
    database, camera, SelectionParams{.threshold = 4.0f});

for (const FrontierEntry& entry : cut)
    submitToRenderer(entry);
```

The rock's root lives directly in the TLAS. Because it has no finer hierarchy,
it allocates no subtree definition or mounted-placement state.

## 2. The architecture in one pass

Frontier separates immutable authored data from mutable placement data:

| Concept | What it represents | Ownership and mutability |
|---|---|---|
| node | one renderable representation of a hierarchy region | payload, error, flags, and authored bounds |
| top-level instance | one permanent renderable root in the TLAS | mutable translation, uniform scale, planar yaw, mask, and world bound |
| subtree definition | one reusable BLAS-like descendant hierarchy | immutable registered serialized bytes |
| mounted placement | one definition attached below one renderable node | accumulated transform and state for mounted descendants |
| spatial query | one camera/view selection | owns per-view selection state, scratch, and output |

An expandable node is called a **mountable node** by the API. It is both a real
renderable fallback and a legal attachment point. It must be a leaf within its
own definition; a different registered definition may be mounted below it at
runtime.

```cpp
SubtreeHandle houseDefinition = /* registered once */;

NodeHandle firstHouseProxy  = /* discovered in a frontier/refinement result */;
NodeHandle secondHouseProxy = /* another placement's proxy */;

SubtreeInstanceHandle firstHouse =
    database.mountSubtree(firstHouseProxy, houseDefinition,
                          firstHouseLocalTransform);
SubtreeInstanceHandle secondHouse =
    database.mountSubtree(secondHouseProxy, houseDefinition,
                          secondHouseLocalTransform);
```

Both placements share the house's immutable topology, bounds, errors, payload
values, and definition-node readiness. Each placement can have different
mounted descendants and therefore logically different coverage. Here,
**coverage** is Frontier's internal proof that a node is ready itself or has a
complete ready descendant cut. Childless placements share the definition's
coverage summary; the first mounted descendant creates a private copy on write.

Four rules explain most of the architecture:

1. Every top-level instance has exactly one permanent renderable root.
2. A subtree definition contains descendants, not a replacement for that root.
3. Definitions are immutable and shareable; placements are mutable and unique.
4. Topology availability and render readiness are independent.

### Performance-oriented integration

Keep one `SpatialQuery` per coherent view, use persistent `MotionGroup` or
`RigidMotionGroup` objects for stable moving cohorts, publish once after a
mutation batch, and disable reuse when the caller knows every cached record
must miss. Query time is output-sensitive and depends on scene shape, camera
coherence, payload width, SIMD width, compiler, and processor. Measure the
complete public workflow—including result consumption—using the workloads and
paired-revision procedure in [BENCHMARKING.md](BENCHMARKING.md).

## 3. Describe one renderable node

`NodeDesc` is used both for TLAS roots and for nodes authored by a
`SubtreeBuilder`:

```cpp
NodeDesc proxy{
    .payload = buildingProxyPayload,
    .geometricError = 32.0f,
    .flags = NodeDesc::FlagMountable,
    .bounds = buildingBounds,
};
```

- `payload` is an opaque application render-resource identifier. Equal values
  may identify the same resource, but do not couple library readiness state.
  `kInvalidPayload` is reserved and cannot be authored. `tryGetPayload()`
  returns it when the supplied `NodeHandle` is stale or invalid.
- `geometricError` is the authored deviation from finer detail, expressed in
  the node hierarchy's local units. Frontier scales and projects it for the
  current camera; zero means this node has no error-driven reason to refine.
- `FlagMountable` makes the node an expandable assembly boundary.
- On a TLAS root, `FlagYawInvariantBounds` promises that the authored bound
  already contains the object's content at every planar yaw. It avoids
  rebuilding a rotating broadphase AABB; do not set it on builder nodes.
- `bounds` is exact six-float authoring storage and accepts an `AABB` directly.

The descriptor occupies 36 bytes with a four-byte payload and 40 bytes with an
eight-byte payload. The remaining flag bits are reserved and must remain zero.
Builders accept only `FlagMountable`; TLAS roots accept both defined flags.

`UserPayload` defaults to `uint64_t`, with `UINT64_MAX` as the invalid value.
Applications can replace both build-wide using preprocessor definitions; the
library and every consumer must use the same definitions:

```cpp
// Build configuration, before including any Frontier header:
#define FRONTIER_USER_PAYLOAD uint32_t
#define FRONTIER_INVALID_PAYLOAD UINT32_MAX
```

Pointer-sized payloads are also supported:

```cpp
#define FRONTIER_USER_PAYLOAD void*
#define FRONTIER_INVALID_PAYLOAD nullptr
```

The configured type must be trivially copyable, default constructible,
equality comparable, have a unique object representation, and occupy exactly
four or eight bytes. Frontier bit-preservingly encodes it once into `uint32_t`
or `uint64_t`; builder storage, registered bytes, and TLAS payload streams use
only that internal word. `tryGetPayload()` performs the inverse conversion in
its inline header-only façade. Pointer payloads work for in-process definitions,
but serialized pointer values cannot be persisted or transferred to another
address space.

```cpp
if (proxy.isMountable()) {
    AABB exactBounds = proxy.bounds;  // exact conversion, no quantization
    scheduleDefinitionLookup(proxy.payload, exactBounds);
}
```

## 4. Author a reusable subtree

`SubtreeBuilder` creates a hierarchy in edit mode. A builder node id exists only
while authoring and is unrelated to a runtime `NodeHandle`.

```cpp
SubtreeBuilder buildingBuilder;
buildingBuilder.reserve(3); // optional allocation hint

SubtreeBuilder::NodeId coarse = buildingBuilder.createNode(NodeDesc{
    .payload = buildingCoarsePayload,
    .geometricError = 24.0f,
    .bounds = buildingBounds,
});

buildingBuilder.createNode(coarse, NodeDesc{
    .payload = buildingLeftPayload,
    .geometricError = 0.0f,
    .bounds = buildingLeftBounds,
});

buildingBuilder.createNode(coarse, NodeDesc{
    .payload = buildingRightPayload,
    .geometricError = 0.0f,
    .bounds = buildingRightBounds,
});

SubtreeBytes buildingBytes = buildingBuilder.build();
```

`createNode(desc)` creates a direct child of the node on which the eventual
definition is mounted. `createNode(parent, desc)` creates a local child of an
earlier builder node. A definition may therefore have several direct nodes; the
serialized representation uses an internal implicit-parent sentinel to keep
those roots contiguous. The sentinel is never renderable and has no public
handle.

`build()` consumes the builder and verifies the authored hierarchy:

- at least one renderable node exists;
- error values are finite and non-negative;
- every final node bound is finite and non-empty on all three axes;
- reserved flag bits are zero;
- no local child exists below a mountable node;
- local fanout is at most 511;
- one definition contains at most 1,048,575 renderable nodes;
- child error is clamped monotonically to its parent's error.

An interior node may start with empty bounds if its children establish a
non-empty result:

```cpp
SubtreeBuilder generated;
auto parent = generated.createNode(NodeDesc{
    .payload = generatedProxy,
    .geometricError = 64.0f,
    .bounds = AABB::empty(),
});
for (const GeneratedPart& part : parts)
    generated.createNode(parent, part.nodeDesc());

SubtreeBytes bytes = generated.build(); // parent bounds include its children
```

## 5. Serialized subtrees and memory ownership

`SubtreeBytes` is an owning, 64-byte-aligned byte array. The builder's output is
simultaneously:

- the serialized file representation;
- the registration input;
- the immutable in-memory traversal representation.

By default, registration validates the header, layout, version, size,
alignment, complete preorder topology, extents, node data, and wide traversal
mirrors, then moves the existing allocation. Validation is linear in node and
wide-block count, but it does not unpack or copy the node arrays and ownership
transfer itself is constant-time. No per-node runtime state is allocated;
shared readiness/coverage state is allocated lazily on the definition's first
mount.

Applications whose registered bytes come exclusively from a trusted,
compatible Frontier builder can compile with
`FRONTIER_VALIDATE_SUBTREES=OFF`. Registration then performs only
constant-time format-envelope and root-range checks before taking ownership;
the O(nodes + wide blocks) structural scan is not compiled in. This is a
build-wide trust decision: malformed internal arrays can otherwise become
unchecked traversal data, so keep validation enabled for files, downloads,
mod content, or any other untrusted or independently versioned input.
If `FRONTIER_CONTRACT_CHECKS` is also disabled, those remaining preconditions
are assumed instead of checked; this is the repository benchmark profile, not
the normal application profile.

```cpp
SubtreeBytes bytes = buildBuildingDefinition().build(context);
writeAll("building.frontier", bytes.bytes()); // application file function

SubtreeHandle building = database.registerSubtree(std::move(bytes));
```

A temporary can be registered directly:

```cpp
SubtreeHandle building =
    database.registerSubtree(buildBuildingDefinition().build(context));
```

Loading allocates the final array before reading:

```cpp
SubtreeBytes bytes(fileSize("building.frontier"), context);
readAll("building.frontier", bytes.bytes()); // application file function

SubtreeHandle building = database.registerSubtree(std::move(bytes));
```

Persisted bytes are a versioned native traversal format, not a long-term
interchange schema. With full validation enabled, registration rejects
incompatible or structurally invalid format versions, layout, size, alignment,
topology, canonical wide traversal data, or byte order. The payload type and
invalid-value configuration must also match the build that authored the bytes;
rebuild assets when any of these change. Registration does not authenticate
content or choose an allocation limit, so verify file origin and size before
allocating `SubtreeBytes`.

Important ownership rules:

- a named `SubtreeBytes` requires `std::move` at registration;
- registering identical bytes twice creates two independent definitions;
- `releaseSubtree()` requires that no mounted placements still reference the
  definition;
- the state referenced by `FrontierContext::user` must outlive every byte array
  and registered definition allocated with that context.

`SubtreeBytes` is explicitly copyable for tools that need duplicate byte
arrays, but registration exposes only the ownership-taking rvalue overload.

All runtime handles are scoped to the `SpatialDatabase` that created them.
Generation stamps reject stale values after removal and slot reuse inside that
database; they are not global database identifiers. Do not pass instance,
definition, placement, or node handles to another database, where the same
packed slot and generation may name unrelated live state.

## 6. Create a root and mount a definition

Every independently movable object begins with `instantiate()`. Set
`FlagMountable` when a deeper definition will attach below the root.

```cpp
InstanceHandle city = database.instantiate(
    NodeDesc{
        .payload = cityFallbackPayload,
        .geometricError = 128.0f,
        .flags = NodeDesc::FlagMountable,
        .bounds = cityLocalBounds,
    },
    InstanceDesc{
        .pos = cityWorldPosition,
        .scale = 1.0f,
        .mask = cityLayerMask,
    });

SubtreeInstanceHandle cityPlacement = database.mountSubtree(
    city.rootNode(), cityDefinition,
    Transform{.pos = float4::point(0, 0, 0), .scale = 1.0f});
```

A mount parent can be either a mountable TLAS root or a mountable leaf in an
existing placement. Mounting verifies that the transformed definition bounds
fit inside the parent and applies the parent's effective error as a ceiling.
The definition bytes are never rewritten.

```cpp
if (!database.hasMountedSubtree(houseProxy)) {
    SubtreeInstanceHandle house = database.mountSubtree(
        houseProxy, houseDefinition,
        Transform{.pos = houseOffsetInBlock, .scale = houseScale});

    if (!house.valid())
        handleExpectedStreamingRace(); // proxy became stale while loading
}
```

An invalid result caused by a stale parent is an expected asynchronous race.
Mounting on a live non-mountable parent, mounting twice, escaping the parent
bounds, or using an invalid definition is a contract violation.

Mount transforms are translation plus positive uniform scale and accumulate
across nested placements. The supplied and accumulated transforms must remain
finite and representable. A top-level mount scale must also have a finite
reciprocal because traversal transforms the camera into placement-local space.

## 7. Select the current frontier and inspect refinement

Mutations become queryable at an update barrier:

```cpp
database.applyUpdates(256);

SpatialQuery mainView;
mainView.setHalfLife(3.0f); // optional view-local LOD damping

FrontierResultView cut = mainView.selectFrontier(
    database,
    cameraFromViewProjection(viewProjection, cameraPosition,
                             viewportHeight, projectionYScale),
    SelectionParams{
        .threshold = 4.0f,
        .minPix = 0.0f,
        .currentCutPolicy = CurrentCutPolicy::PreferReadyDescendants,
    });
```

`threshold` is the desired maximum projected geometric error in pixels: lower
values refine more aggressively. `minPix` optionally rejects top-level
instances whose conservative projected bounds diameter is too small. It is
independent of authored geometric error, so a large object is not discarded
merely because its coarse representation is accurate. Query-local **damping**
smooths LOD decisions over camera motion by evaluating a conservative temporal
camera envelope; it does not modify scene state. The query's reuse cache is a
separate optimization that returns a previous exact cut while its recorded
decision margins remain valid. A snapshot containing only TLAS-owned
single-node objects automatically uses the direct selection path instead;
there is no hierarchy walk for a cache hit to avoid.

For the common overview case with no layer or contribution filter, a query
whose conservative TLAS root lanes remain wholly inside the frustum retains
its complete visible-instance stream. Revalidation then tests only those root
lanes instead of rewriting and comparing one item per instance. Instance
addition, removal, slot reuse, or physical reorder advances a mapping epoch and
forces an exact stream rebuild.

The normal query-owned-view overload also recognizes up to two recurring exact
camera/parameter states when damping and mount-usage tracking are disabled. A
view must recur before Frontier snapshots its complete cut, so continuously
moving one-off cameras do not copy output. Later exact matches return that
snapshot directly while instance mapping, spatial, and content generations are
unchanged. This targets stereo/portal pairs, alternating shadow views, editor
bookmarks, and deterministic camera oscillation; any scene mutation or query
parameter change falls back to ordinary exact selection automatically. The
memoized output capacity is included in `SpatialQuery::bytes()`.

`currentCutPolicy` controls how an unavailable threshold-target choice is replaced:

- `PreferReadyDescendants` uses a complete ready descendant cut when one
  exists, falling back to a ready ancestor only when that cover is incomplete.
  This default normally preserves the most detail.
- `PreferReadyAncestors` never searches below the unavailable threshold target. It
  falls back upward, normally producing a smaller but coarser current cut.

### Two current-cut policies

The following three diagrams show the same hierarchy and camera decision.
Green nodes are ready, yellow nodes are unavailable, and the colored region
marks the selected frontier.

The threshold-directed target is `D, H, I, J, F, G`. It describes the choices
an exhaustive refinement analysis would reach, but it
cannot be rendered in this example because `H`, `I`, `J`, and `G` are not
ready:

![Threshold target containing unavailable nodes](images/cuts/threshold-target.svg)

`PreferReadyAncestors` produces the compact current frontier `D, E, C`.
Unavailable `H/I/J` retreat to their ready ancestor `E`; unavailable `G`
retreats to `C`. Selecting `C` also replaces its ready child `F`, because a cut
cannot contain both an ancestor and its descendant:

![Compact current frontier using ready ancestors](images/cuts/current-cut-ancestors.svg)

`PreferReadyDescendants` produces the detailed current frontier
`D, E, F, K, M, N, O`. The complete ready descendant cut `K, M, N, O` covers
the unavailable `G`, so `F` can remain selected independently. If even one
visible branch below `G` lacked ready coverage, Frontier would fall back to
the ready ancestor `C` instead:

![Detailed current frontier using ready descendants](images/cuts/current-cut-descendants.svg)

Render the zero-copy current-cut view:

```cpp
for (const FrontierEntry& entry : cut) {
    if (UserPayload payload = database.tryGetPayload(entry.nodeHandle);
        payload != kInvalidPayload)
        submitPayload(payload, entry.instance());
}
```

Handles in a freshly returned cut resolve throughout that published read
interval. `tryGetPayload()` is stale-safe because applications may also retain
node handles across writer phases; failure in the loop above would indicate
that the threading contract was violated.

### Bounded refinement analysis

`computeFrontierRefinement()` describes structurally valid ways to improve the
current cut. It does not choose a streaming plan or materialize a second
frontier:

```cpp
FrontierRefinementView refinement = mainView.computeFrontierRefinement(
    database, cut, 3, 4096);

for (uint32_t group = 0; group < refinement.groupCount(); ++group) {
    NodeHandle parent = refinement.parent(group);
    std::span<const FrontierEntry> children = refinement.children(group);
    streamingPlanner.considerCompleteGroup(parent, children,
                                            refinement.depth(group));
}
```

The call scans the complete current cut and starts only from entries whose
projected error is over the retained selection threshold. It follows already
mounted topology, including mounted-definition boundaries, and recomputes
child visibility and error with the exact damped camera, transforms, error
clamps, and bounds overlays retained by the preceding selection. Readiness is
deliberately ignored: a group describes a possible finer cover, and the
application decides which missing resources to request. The walk stops at
below-threshold entries, terminal nodes, and unmounted boundaries.

Each group has the following contract:

- `parent(group)` is an existing node. At depth 1 it is in `cut`; at greater
  depths it is a child in an earlier group.
- `children(group)` is the complete set of that parent's visible immediate
  children. Authored children outside the retained frustum are absent by
  design. A parent with no visible children does not produce a group.
- `depth(group)` counts refinement transitions below `cut`, starting at 1.
- groups are ordered breadth-first. `findGroup(node)` returns the group that
  expands `node`, or `kInvalidIndex` when none was emitted.
- `entries()` concatenates every child span for bulk inspection but does not
  preserve the group boundaries. Each entry retains the top-level
  `InstanceId` and a fresh error code relative to `threshold()`.

At a mount boundary, the mountable node remains the group parent and the
mounted definition's visible root nodes form its child span. The method never
invents an unmounted definition and never coarsens a current entry that is
already finer than the threshold-directed stopping rule.

`maxDepth` must be positive and counts the transitions described above;
`SpatialQuery::UnlimitedDepth` requests exhaustive traversal of known mounted
topology. `maxNodes` bounds the total number of returned child entries and may
be zero. The node limit is group-atomic: if the next complete group does not
fit, none of it is returned and traversal stops. A finite depth by itself is
also a complete decision horizon—every group through that depth is intact. A
`maxNodes` stop can still make the returned analysis incomplete.

The status methods describe truncation of this analysis:

- `complete()` means neither requested bound stopped the walk. It does not mean
  that resources are resident or that the application has loaded every
  possible unmounted definition.
- `depthLimitReached()` means an over-threshold node at the horizon has finer
  mounted topology. The diagnostic is conservative because visibility beyond
  the horizon is not evaluated just to improve the flag.
- `nodeLimitReached()` means the next breadth-first group did not fit.
- `empty()` means no groups were emitted; inspect the limit flags to distinguish
  an already-satisfied/terminal cut from a zero or insufficient node budget.

Unlimited traversal can be proportional to all visible threshold-directed
nodes below current. `maxNodes` bounds returned storage, not every unit of work:
the implementation must still scan current and inspect the immediate group
that encounters the limit. Use both finite depth and node bounds when the
caller needs a tight decision horizon.

The source frontier has a strict provenance contract. It must be the complete,
unchanged result of this `SpatialQuery`'s immediately preceding
`selectFrontier()` call. Repeated refinement calls are allowed until another
selection occurs. Query-owned views, non-overflowed fixed-sink storage wrapped
as a `FrontierResultView`, and owning `FrontierResult` output are accepted. A
truncated fixed sink, a copied or modified entry sequence, output from another
query, and `selectRenderFrontier()` output are not. The database must also be
the query's bound database, with no published mapping, spatial, or content
change since selection. Contract violations route through `FRONTIER_FATAL`.

The returned view is query-owned. It remains valid until the next selection,
refinement computation, `reset()`, move assignment, or destruction of that
query. `threshold()` remains available so the application can decode each
entry with `approximateError(refinement.threshold())`.

### Applying refinement groups

To construct a candidate cut, begin with `cut` and replace a parent only with
its entire child span. A deeper group can be applied only after the groups that
make its parent present. This parent-before-child rule allows a planner to skip
an intermediate representation while preserving complete coverage:

```cpp
CandidateCut candidate(cut.entries);
for (uint32_t group = 0; group < refinement.groupCount(); ++group) {
    const frontier::NodeHandle parent = refinement.parent(group);

    if (!candidate.contains(parent) ||
        !streamingPlanner.accept(parent,
                                 refinement.children(group),
                                 refinement.depth(group)))
        continue;

    candidate.replaceWholeGroup(parent, refinement.children(group));
}
```

The helper types above are application policy, not Frontier API. In an
asynchronous renderer, planners commonly request the missing members of an
accepted group and keep its parent selected until all required children are
ready. The next ordinary selection then advances the renderable cut without a
partial sibling transition. Byte budgets, priorities, request coalescing,
cross-camera aggregation, and eviction remain application responsibilities.

Topology demand starts with over-threshold mountable nodes in current and
continues through the bounded refinement entries:

```cpp
auto requestMissingTopology = [&](std::span<const FrontierEntry> entries) {
    for (const FrontierEntry& entry : entries) {
        if (!entry.overThreshold() ||
            database.hasMountedSubtree(entry.nodeHandle))
            continue;

        if (UserPayload payload = database.tryGetPayload(entry.nodeHandle);
            payload != kInvalidPayload && content.isExpandable(payload))
            requestChildDefinition(entry.nodeHandle, payload);
    }
};

requestMissingTopology(cut.entries);
requestMissingTopology(refinement.entries());
```

`FrontierResultView` points into its `SpatialQuery` and remains valid until that
query's next selection, `reset()`, or destruction. Use `FrontierResult` for an
owning copy or `Sink<FrontierEntry>` to write directly into fixed caller
memory.

Each `FrontierEntry` carries a generation-stamped `NodeHandle`, an
`InstanceId` stable for the lifetime of its top-level instance, and a
threshold-relative error code. The instance id is appropriate for indexing the
application's top-level transform or entity table while that instance is live.

### Renderer-facing current-cut output

The handle cut is the authoritative path for topology, readiness, and
refinement work. Rendering code has two additional ways to avoid one payload
lookup per entry.

For a retained or caller-owned handle cut, resolve the whole span into
caller-owned contiguous storage:

```cpp
std::vector<ResolvedFrontierEntry> resolved(cut.size());
std::span<ResolvedFrontierEntry> renderEntries =
    database.resolveFrontier(cut.entries, resolved);

for (const ResolvedFrontierEntry& entry : renderEntries)
    renderer.submit(entry.payload, entry.instance(), entry.errorCode());
```

`resolveFrontier()` preserves order and the packed instance/error metadata. It
validates consecutive entries from one mounted placement as a run, returns
`kInvalidPayload` for a stale handle, and returns an empty span without writing
when the destination is too small.

When hierarchical reuse is enabled, `selectRenderFrontier()` retains resolved
payloads and one-byte error codes in the same per-instance cache slabs as the
selected cuts. Cache hits then append only compact per-instance runs:

```cpp
RenderFrontierView render = mainView.selectRenderFrontier(
    database, camera, params);

for (const RenderFrontierRun& run : render.runs()) {
    RenderFrontierSpan span = render[run];
    for (size_t i = 0; i < span.size(); ++i)
        renderer.submit(span.payloads[i], span.instance, span.errors[i]);
}
```

`size()` is the logical entry count and `segmentCount()` is the number of runs.
The payload and error storage spans are backing slabs; consume only the ranges
addressed by `runs()`. In reuse-disabled and all-flat scenes the method
materializes a contiguous fallback but exposes the same run interface.
`setInstanceRenderAsUnit()` can conservatively keep an accepted boundary
instance's complete cached cut instead of repeating descendant frustum culling.

The render view remains valid until that query's next selection or `reset()`,
or until the query is destroyed. A render-native call deliberately does not
leave the handle frontier required by `computeFrontierRefinement()`. Use
`selectFrontier()`—often on a separate, lower-cadence streaming query—when the
same frame also needs handle or refinement analysis.

### Fully resident max-detail output

If a view always renders fully ready, zero-error terminal leaves, avoid
materializing and resolving a handle for every leaf. `TerminalRenderQuery`
returns immutable payload ranges with the instance id hoisted into each run:

```cpp
TerminalRenderQuery query;
TerminalRenderView view = query.select(database, camera);

for (const TerminalRenderRun run : view.runs()) {
    const InstanceId instance = run.instance();
    for (UserPayload payload : run.payloadSpan())
        renderer.submit(payload, instance, run.errorCode());
}
```

`view.size()` is still the number of logical leaf submissions; range output
does not remove downstream work from the measurement or API. It removes the
intermediate per-leaf `NodeHandle`, instance id, error byte, payload-resolution
lookup, and query-owned resolved copy. The view and payload pointers remain
valid until this query's next selection/reset or a database mutation.

This path requires every selected mounted tree to be fully ready, overlay-free,
free of nested mount points, and terminated by zero-error leaves. Use ordinary
`SpatialQuery` for streamed LOD, partial readiness, deformation, or nested
topology. By default instances
marked with `setInstanceRenderAsUnit()` retain their whole terminal range when
the root intersects the frustum; pass `false` as the fourth `select()` argument
when exact descendant culling is required.

Large homogeneous moving populations can keep transforms in the simulation's
own split streams and submit them through `TerminalInstanceBatch`. These batch
instances do not enter the general-instance TLAS:

```cpp
TerminalInstanceBatch cars;
cars.definition = carDefinition;
cars.localBounds = carRootBounds;
cars.positions = simulation.carPositions();
cars.yaws = simulation.carYaws();
cars.clusters = simulation.carSpatialClusters(); // optional {first,count}
cars.clusterBounds = simulation.carClusterEnvelopes(); // optional conservative bounds
cars.firstInstance = carInstanceBase;
cars.yawInvariantBounds = true;

std::array batches{cars};
TerminalRenderView view = query.select(database, camera, batches);
```

Static and heterogeneous instances in `database` still use its TLAS. Batch
roots are tested directly from caller memory; fully visible actors append one
payload range and only partial actors descend the definition. Position/yaw
storage must remain valid for the call. Batches use consecutive caller-assigned
instance ids, constant scale/mask/bounds per cohort, fully resident terminal
definitions, and no general `InstanceHandle`. They are best for hundreds or
thousands of same-shape actors; use ordinary instances when streaming,
deformation, per-actor scale/mask variation, handle operations, or a dynamic
broadphase is more important than zero-copy publication.

Optional clusters are immutable index ranges and must partition a spatially
ordered position stream. With an empty `clusterBounds` span, selection computes
each exact current union from actor transforms, so this safe default cannot
become stale. A caller may instead provide one conservative AABB per cluster.
That can be a lifetime motion envelope built once (well suited to actors constrained
to a road/cell), or a current snapshot published before `select()`. Every bound
must contain every current member root; contract builds verify coverage. An
outside cluster skips all members, a fully inside cluster emits each actor's
root range, and only a boundary cluster performs per-actor plane tests. Looser
envelopes remain correct but cause more member work; an under-bound envelope is
a contract violation.

## 8. Stream topology and render readiness independently

Mounting makes finer topology known. Marking a node ready says the renderer has
every GPU resource needed to dispatch that node's payload. These operations
intentionally happen at different times.

### Example: readiness follows GPU resources

Suppose a building hierarchy is already mounted and therefore known to
Frontier, but some wall meshes or materials are not in GPU memory yet. The
current cut uses ready ancestors or complete ready descendant covers as
fallbacks. Ask for a bounded decision horizon, then let application policy
choose complete groups that fit its external resource budget:

```cpp
FrontierRefinementView refinement = query.computeFrontierRefinement(
    database, cut, 4, 8192);

for (uint32_t group = 0; group < refinement.groupCount(); ++group) {
    const auto children = refinement.children(group);
    if (!streamingPolicy.acceptWholeGroup(database, children))
        continue;

    for (const FrontierEntry& entry : children) {
        if (database.isNodeReady(entry.nodeHandle))
            continue;
        if (UserPayload payload = database.tryGetPayload(entry.nodeHandle);
            payload != kInvalidPayload)
            gpuStreamer.request(entry.nodeHandle, payload);
    }
}

// Applied later, during a writer phase after the upload finishes.
for (const GpuCompletion& completed : gpuStreamer.completed())
    database.markNodeReady(completed.node);
```

The readiness test is still necessary: a complete candidate group may contain
children that are already ready. The planner evaluates the siblings together
because loading only an incomplete replacement cover cannot improve the
hole-free current frontier. No topology is mounted or unmounted in this
example.

The reverse is equally important. A coarse building node may become unavailable
after all of its wall descendants are ready. Because those walls form a
complete ready cut, the current frontier keeps rendering them; it does not
require the coarse ancestor to remain ready. Only a gap in that descendant cut
forces selection back to a ready ancestor.

### Example: mounting reveals local detail

Now consider a planet-scale hierarchy. From orbit, the database needs only the
planet, continent, and coarse terrain nodes. Individual city blocks, buildings,
and walls do not need to be known at all. As the camera approaches the surface,
an over-threshold mountable proxy in the current cut asks the application to
load and mount its child definition:

```cpp
for (const FrontierEntry& entry : cut) {
    const UserPayload payload = database.tryGetPayload(entry.nodeHandle);
    if (payload == kInvalidPayload)
        continue;

    if (entry.overThreshold() && planetContent.isExpandable(payload))
        topologyStreamer.request(entry.nodeHandle,
                                 planetContent.childAsset(payload));
}

// Applied later, during the writer phase.
for (TopologyCompletion& completed : topologyStreamer.completed()) {
    SubtreeHandle detail = definitionCache.getOrRegister(
        completed.asset, database);
    database.mountSubtree(completed.parent, detail, completed.transform);
}
```

Until the child is mounted, known topology stops at the proxy. Its
over-threshold error is what signals that more topology is wanted. A bounded
refinement result can expose additional such boundaries within its lookahead
horizon. The application's request queue should coalesce repeated requests
while a child definition is loading.

After mounting, the next selection can expose much finer nodes around the
camera. Those nodes are commonly unready at first, so the first loop requests
their GPU resources and `markNodeReady()` publishes each completed upload.
While the camera flies across the surface, the application keeps expanding
over-threshold proxies ahead of it and removes detail behind it either
explicitly with `unmountSubtree()` or by enabling query mount-usage feedback
and calling `collect()` with a placement budget. The result is a small moving
window of detailed topology rather than a fully expanded planet.

Readiness belongs to one node in one registered definition. A `NodeHandle` from
any live placement identifies that definition node, and the change applies to
every current and future placement of the same definition:

```cpp
void nodeUploadCompleted(NodeHandle node)
{
    database.markNodeReady(node);
}

void makeNodeUnavailable(NodeHandle node)
{
    database.markNodeUnavailable(node);
}
```

Equal `UserPayload` values in different nodes or definitions remain independent.
If those values refer to one GPU allocation, the integration may mark each
corresponding definition node together. Frontier deliberately does not build a
payload index or impose resource-identity policy.

Once published, readiness remains on the registered definition even if all of
its placements are temporarily unmounted. A later mount inherits it. Releasing
the definition discards it. Publishing requires a live mounted `NodeHandle`;
stale handles are ignored and `isNodeReady()` returns `false` for them.

Readiness and topology-independent coverage live once in the definition's
shared node-state block. A childless placement points directly at that state.
When a placement receives a mounted descendant it takes a private coverage copy
because its completeness can now differ from other placements. Coverage
propagates toward the root so the current cut remains complete while
intermediate nodes are unavailable.

TLAS roots are always ready because they are the permanent fallback:

```cpp
bool rootReady = database.isNodeReady(instance.rootNode()); // true
database.markNodeReady(instance.rootNode());                 // no-op
```

Calling `markNodeUnavailable()` on a live TLAS root is a contract violation.

An asynchronous topology completion normally retains only the parent handle:

```cpp
void definitionLoadCompleted(NodeHandle parent, SubtreeBytes bytes,
                             Transform placement)
{
    SubtreeHandle definition = database.registerSubtree(std::move(bytes));
    SubtreeInstanceHandle mounted =
        database.mountSubtree(parent, definition, placement);

    if (!mounted.valid() && database.isSubtree(definition))
        database.releaseSubtree(definition); // parent disappeared before mount
}
```

Applications commonly cache definitions separately instead of releasing them
after one stale request.

## 9. Move roots, placements, and individual nodes

Frontier distinguishes three kinds of movement.

### Move an entire top-level object

`moveInstance()` changes the translation, uniform scale, and planar yaw of the
permanent root and everything mounted below it. Exact instance state changes at
submission time; the TLAS snapshot is published by the next
`applyUpdates(maintenanceNodeBudget)`:

```cpp
database.moveInstance(carInstance, InstanceTransform{
    .pos = newCarPosition,
    .scale = 1.0f,
    .yaw = carYaw,
});
```

Positions and scales must be finite, scales must be positive with a finite
reciprocal, and transformed root bounds and errors must remain representable.
Invalid motion is rejected before the instance or TLAS is changed.

For a stable cohort, `MotionGroup` preserves caller order while caching the
database's physical order:

```cpp
SpatialDatabase::MotionGroup trafficGroup(trafficInstances);

// positions[i] corresponds to trafficInstances[i].
database.moveInstances(trafficGroup, positions, 1.0f);

// Or submit independent rigid placements, including yaw, in the same stable
// caller order.
database.moveInstances(trafficGroup, vehicleTransforms);
```

For a large rigid cohort with fixed per-instance scale, retain positions and
yaws as separate streams and use `RigidMotionGroup`:

```cpp
SpatialDatabase::RigidMotionGroup rigidTraffic(vehicleInstances);

// Both spans remain in the same stable caller order as vehicleInstances.
database.moveRigidInstances(rigidTraffic, vehiclePositions, vehicleYaws);
```

If every root carries `FlagYawInvariantBounds`, eligibility is cached until the
physical instance mapping changes. Each frame then streams the dense instance
and orientation arrays, translates the existing exact broadphase box, and
updates yaw without loading an unused scale from an AoS transform or entering
the general oriented-bound reconstruction path. Mixed/non-invariant cohorts
remain exact by falling back to the ordinary transform kernel.

When the complete cohort shares one translation, submit that fact directly:

```cpp
database.translateInstances(trafficGroup, frameDelta);
```

`translateInstances()` is the preferred shared-delta rigid-motion path. A group
covering the complete live population updates one deferred world offset in
O(1), without rewriting instance records or TLAS nodes. A differential edit,
addition, or rebuild materializes that offset transparently. Subsets update
their exact instance transforms. At publication, cohorts below one quarter of
the TLAS population reuse grow-only swept leaf envelopes; larger cohorts
replace scattered per-mover ancestor walks with one exact bottom-up TLAS refit.
Every loose small-cohort leaf is queued for optional tightening. The maintenance
budget passed to `applyUpdates(maintenanceNodeBudget)` repairs queued nodes and
propagates shrinkage toward the root over later calls. Unprocessed nodes remain
conservative and queryable. Dense-motion exact refit remains a publication
strategy because it
is cheaper than many scattered grow paths; it is not an optional topology
rebuild and does not consume the maintenance budget.

Here **dense order** means Frontier's compact internal instance-slot order. It
may change during `optimize(OptimizationMode::TopologyAndLayout)`. Public
`InstanceHandle` identity remains stable, and `MotionGroup` retains caller
order.

This is the recommended path when the same collection moves repeatedly, such
as traffic, particles, units, or a streamed terrain patch set. The application
can keep its natural stable order—`positions[i]` always belongs to the handle
originally stored at `i`—while Frontier updates the corresponding dense
instance records in physical database order.

Physical ordering matters for non-global movement because it writes the
instance record, its translation-travel odometer, and potentially one TLAS
leaf-to-root path. After spatial
optimization, nearby dense records also tend to occupy nearby TLAS branches.
Walking the cached order therefore turns otherwise scattered instance writes
into a mostly sequential stream and reuses nearby TLAS cache lines. It also
avoids resolving or validating every public handle on every frame. One database
mapping epoch proves the complete cached order valid; add, remove, slot reuse,
and physical reorder advance that epoch and force a safe group refresh.

Pure translation or yaw does not automatically discard a reusable frontier.
Frontier charges translation plus a conservative bound on angular point
displacement against the same exact decision margin used for camera travel.
Small-batch TLAS leaf envelopes remain conservative; queries that reach a loose
leaf retest its current instance bound exactly. Large-batch publication shrinks
those envelopes back to exact bounds. A scale change still
invalidates the affected record because it changes geometric error as well as
distance.

For a retained complete cut, `MotionGroup` also contributes the largest member
translation to a database-wide motion odometer. The query's minimum remaining
margin can then certify every root at once without probing the per-instance
record array. Scale, deformation, topology, readiness, mapping changes, and a
failed TLAS-root visibility proof reject this shortcut conservatively.

The first update after construction or `reset()` resolves and sorts the cohort.
The database automatically rebuilds that cache after
`optimize(OptimizationMode::TopologyAndLayout)` or another physical layout
change; ordinary frames only perform the ordered O(n) update.
Keep a `MotionGroup` alive across frames to amortize the sort—recreating it each
frame throws away the benefit. Use individual `moveInstance()` calls for
occasional movement or changing cohorts. Use `translateInstances()` whenever a
cohort shares one delta; use the position overload of `moveInstances()` for
absolute positions or a shared scale, and the `InstanceTransform` overload for
independent scale and yaw.

For stable-scale actors with independently changing yaw, prefer
`RigidMotionGroup` and `moveRigidInstances()` over the AoS transform overload;
keep the general overload for scale animation or an authoritative AoS source.

### Place a mounted definition

The `Transform` passed to `mountSubtree()` is fixed for that placement and is
accumulated into top-level instance-local coordinates. The current API does not
mutate a mount transform in place. Replace a rigid placement by unmounting and
mounting it again:

```cpp
database.unmountSubtree(oldPlacement);
SubtreeInstanceHandle replacement =
    database.mountSubtree(parentNode, definition, newPlacementTransform);
```

That replacement starts with fresh coverage and inherits the registered
definition nodes' current readiness.

### Change one node's effective bound

Node animation and deformation remain application-owned. Submit the resulting
local bound for the affected top-level instance:

```cpp
database.setNodeBounds(carInstance, movingDoorNode,
                       animatedDoorBoundsInDefinitionSpace);

// Optional immediate tool/readback barrier; applyUpdates(budget) also flushes.
database.flushBounds();
AABB effective = database.nodeBounds(carInstance, movingDoorNode);
```

The first edit to an `(instance, mounted placement)` pair creates a private
copy-on-write bounds overlay. Topology, payloads, errors, readiness, and every
other placement remain shared. Ancestor propagation is conservative and
grow-only. Bounds must be finite and non-empty, remain representable through
every containing mount and instance transform, and belong to the supplied
instance; these requirements are checked in release builds.

`setNodeBounds()` does not create a render transform. Use
`tryGetNodeTransform()` to obtain the containing mount's accumulated transform,
then compose it with the application-owned node pose and top-level transform:

```cpp
Transform mountToInstance;
if (database.tryGetNodeTransform(movingDoorNode, mountToInstance))
    updateRenderTransform(movingDoorNode, mountToInstance, animatedDoorPose);
```

## 10. Reclaim cold mounted placements

Definitions and TLAS roots are explicit-lifetime objects. Mounted placements
can additionally be collected by a least-recently-used (LRU) policy. A query
contributes retention feedback only when enabled:

```cpp
SpatialQuery streamingView;
streamingView.setMountUsageEnabled(true);

database.applyUpdates(256);
streamingView.selectFrontier(database, camera, params);

CollectResult collected = database.collect(
    streamingView,
    maxMountedSubtrees,
    minimumUnusedEpochs);
```

Collection removes eligible leaf placements from the LRU tail until the mount
budget is met. A placement must be old enough and have no mounted children.
Collection changes topology only. It never changes or reports definition-node
readiness; a later placement of the same registered definition inherits the
retained state. GPU resource eviction remains an application-level decision.

Several views can contribute usage before one collection pass:

```cpp
std::array<SpatialQuery*, 2> retentionViews{&mainView, &shadowView};
CollectResult result = database.collect(retentionViews, mountBudget, minAge);
```

Use `subtreeInstanceStateBytes()`, `overlayCount()`, and `overlayBytes()` to
track mutable hierarchy cost. The first metric includes mount records, shared
coverage/readiness summaries and private coverage copies, but excludes
registered bytes.

## 11. Update and threading model

`SpatialDatabase` uses a publish/read discipline:

1. one writer performs registration, assembly, motion, readiness changes, and
   collection;
2. the writer calls `applyUpdates(maintenanceNodeBudget)`;
3. any number of readers select concurrently, each with a distinct
   `SpatialQuery`;
4. all reads finish before the next write.

```cpp
// Single-writer phase.
applyStreamingCompletions(database);
applySimulationMotion(database);
UpdateReport update = database.applyUpdates(256);
if (update.topologyRebuildRecommended)
    scheduleTlasRebuildAtAnApplicationChosenSafePoint();

// Read-only phase. Each task owns a different query.
runConcurrently(
    [&] { mainCut = mainQuery.selectFrontier(database, mainCamera, params); },
    [&] { shadowCut = shadowQuery.selectFrontier(database, shadowCamera, params); });

// Join before mutating again.
consumeCuts(mainCut, shadowCut);
database.collect(mainQuery, mountBudget, minAge);
```

A `SpatialQuery` is mutable and cannot be used concurrently, even against the
same database. It binds to the first database it reads; `reset()` releases that
binding and clears damping/reuse history while retaining allocations.

Call `applyUpdates(budget)` once per publication group even if no content
changed; it also advances the epoch used by collection aging. The budget is the
maximum number of queued TLAS nodes whose conservative bounds may be tightened
in that call. Zero publishes without optional tightening. A finite value spreads
maintenance across frames, and `kUnlimitedTlasMaintenance` drains the queue.
The returned `UpdateReport` contains processed and pending node counts, current
area growth, whether a topology rebuild is recommended, and whether a
correctness-required build occurred.

`applyUpdates(maintenanceNodeBudget)` never performs an optional topology
rebuild. Population drift, incremental edit count, and stored-area growth only set
`topologyRebuildRecommended`. The application answers that advice with one
explicit safe-point operation and an explicit scope:

```cpp
database.optimize(OptimizationMode::TopologyOnly);
database.optimize(OptimizationMode::TopologyAndLayout);
```

- `TopologyOnly` flushes pending state and rebuilds exact TLAS topology with
  the linear-pass `SpatialBins` builder. It leaves dead dense slots and
  physical instance order untouched, so cached `MotionGroup` mappings remain
  valid.
- `TopologyAndLayout` additionally compacts dead dense instance slots,
  spatially reorders instance/query-record storage, and rebuilds with the
  configured quality tier.

Neither mode advances collection age. Public handles and
`FrontierEntry` instance ids remain stable.

## 12. Configure allocation, TLAS quality, and parallel selection

`FrontierContext` supplies aligned allocation for serialized subtrees and an
optional blocking `parallelFor` callback. `SpatialDatabaseConfig` selects TLAS
build quality and optimization-recommendation thresholds.

```cpp
FrontierContext context{
    .alloc = &engineAlignedAlloc,
    .free = &engineAlignedFree,
    .parallelFor = &engineParallelFor,
    .workerCount = workerCount,
    .user = allocatorAndSchedulerState,
};

SpatialDatabaseConfig config{
    .context = context,
    .tlasQuality = TlasQuality::BinnedSAH,
    .tlasTraversalCost = 1.0f,
    .tlasIntersectCost = 1.0f,
    .tlasCountDrift = 0.2f,
    .tlasAreaDrift = 0.5f,
    .tlasEditFraction = 0.05f,
    .parallelInstanceThreshold = 4096,
};

SpatialDatabase database(config);
```

`BinnedSAH` uses a binned surface-area heuristic to build a tighter TLAS at a
higher rebuild cost. `SpatialBins` uses linear count/scatter passes and
`Median` uses comparison-based longest-axis partitioning. The drift thresholds
decide when `UpdateReport` recommends explicit optimization; they never cause
one implicitly. Use `optimize(OptimizationMode::TopologyOnly)` for a lower-cost
SpatialBins rebuild during ordinary simulation and
`optimize(OptimizationMode::TopologyAndLayout)` when compaction or the
configured higher-quality topology is worth the extra cost.

`parallelFor` must block until all requested tasks finish. Internal parallel
selection is used only for uncached queries, above the configured visible
instance threshold, and when `workerCount > 1`:

```cpp
SpatialQuery uncached;
uncached.setReuseEnabled(false);
FrontierResultView cut = uncached.selectFrontier(database, camera, params);
```

Database construction rejects unknown TLAS quality values and non-finite or
negative cost/drift settings. `optimize(mode)` rejects unknown modes.
If parallel selection is enabled with more than one worker, `parallelFor` must
be non-null. Selection likewise rejects invalid cameras, thresholds, culling
limits, and current-cut policy values before traversal begins.

Contract violations route through `FRONTIER_FATAL`. With compiler exception
support enabled, the default throws `std::logic_error`; under
`-fno-exceptions`, the default aborts. A host can define the macro before any
Frontier include to use its own non-returning panic handler. Treat this as a
programmer-error hook, not a recoverable input-error channel: unless a function
explicitly says otherwise, Frontier does not promise transactional rollback
after a contract failure.

Internal retained-storage exhaustion is separate from caller contracts. The
append buffer preserves the standard `std::length_error`/`std::bad_alloc`
behavior when exceptions are enabled and aborts when they are disabled.

## 13. End-to-end example: reusable houses in a streamed city

This example builds one reusable house definition and a city definition whose
house proxies are mountable. The application decides that each proxy maps to
the same house handle.

```cpp
// Build and register the reusable house.
SubtreeBuilder houseBuilder;
auto houseCoarse = houseBuilder.createNode(NodeDesc{
    .payload = houseCoarsePayload,
    .geometricError = 8.0f,
    .bounds = houseBounds,
});
houseBuilder.createNode(houseCoarse, NodeDesc{
    .payload = houseFinePayload,
    .geometricError = 0.0f,
    .bounds = houseBounds,
});
SubtreeHandle houseDefinition =
    database.registerSubtree(houseBuilder.build());

// Build the city from renderable district/block LODs and lightweight
// mountable house proxies. Each authored fanout stays at or below 511.
SubtreeBuilder cityBuilder;
for (const District& district : authoredCity.districts) {
    auto districtNode = cityBuilder.createNode(NodeDesc{
        .payload = district.coarsePayload,
        .geometricError = 96.0f,
        .bounds = district.boundsInCity,
    });

    for (const Block& block : district.blocks) {
        auto blockNode = cityBuilder.createNode(districtNode, NodeDesc{
            .payload = block.coarsePayload,
            .geometricError = 48.0f,
            .bounds = block.boundsInCity,
        });

        for (const HousePlacement& house : block.houses) {
            cityBuilder.createNode(blockNode, NodeDesc{
                // In this example the payload indexes the house's authored
                // placement metadata as well as its proxy render data.
                .payload = house.proxyPayload,
                .geometricError = 32.0f,
                .flags = NodeDesc::FlagMountable,
                .bounds = house.conservativeBoundsInCity,
            });
        }
    }
}
SubtreeHandle cityDefinition =
    database.registerSubtree(cityBuilder.build());

// One permanent root owns the assembled runtime tree.
InstanceHandle city = database.instantiate(
    NodeDesc{
        .payload = cityFallbackPayload,
        .geometricError = 128.0f,
        .flags = NodeDesc::FlagMountable,
        .bounds = authoredCity.bounds,
    },
    InstanceDesc{.pos = cityWorldPosition});

database.mountSubtree(city.rootNode(), cityDefinition);
```

The streaming loop discovers mountable proxies from current and evaluates
resource demand as complete refinement groups:

```cpp
void requestReadiness(const FrontierRefinementView& refinement)
{
    for (uint32_t group = 0; group < refinement.groupCount(); ++group) {
        const auto children = refinement.children(group);
        if (!streamingPolicy.acceptWholeGroup(database, children))
            continue;

        for (const FrontierEntry& entry : children) {
            if (database.isNodeReady(entry.nodeHandle))
                continue;
            if (UserPayload payload = database.tryGetPayload(entry.nodeHandle);
                payload != kInvalidPayload)
                payloadStreamer.request(entry.nodeHandle, payload);
        }
    }
}

void expandHouses(FrontierResultView current)
{
    for (const FrontierEntry& entry : current) {
        if (!entry.overThreshold() ||
            database.hasMountedSubtree(entry.nodeHandle))
            continue;

        const UserPayload payload =
            database.tryGetPayload(entry.nodeHandle);
        if (payload == kInvalidPayload ||
            !applicationSaysHouseProxy(payload))
            continue;

        // The application authored the proxy-to-house placement together
        // with the proxy payload. Different proxies reuse the same bytes
        // with different local transforms.
        const Transform placement =
            authoredCity.housePlacementFor(payload);
        database.mountSubtree(entry.nodeHandle, houseDefinition, placement);
    }
}

database.applyUpdates(256);
FrontierResultView cut = cityQuery.selectFrontier(database, camera, params);
FrontierRefinementView refinement = cityQuery.computeFrontierRefinement(
    database, cut, 3, 8192);
requestReadiness(refinement);
expandHouses(cut);
```

The city can contain a million proxies without duplicating the house
definition. A mounted house needs one compact placement record, but childless
house placements share the house definition's coverage/readiness state. The
city placement takes private coverage only when one of its proxies receives a
mounted descendant.

## 14. End-to-end example: asynchronous payload and topology streaming

Keep generation-stamped handles in asynchronous topology and readiness
requests. A stale readiness completion is safely ignored. If the underlying GPU
resource is shared by several definition nodes, the integration can track those
nodes by payload and publish the completion to each live representative. Queue
completions and apply them during the next single-writer phase.

```cpp
struct PayloadRequest {
    NodeHandle node;
    UserPayload payload;
};

struct DefinitionRequest {
    NodeHandle parent;
    AssetId asset;
    Transform placement;
};

void applyCompletions()
{
    for (PayloadRequest& done : payloadStreamer.completed()) {
        uploadToGpu(done.payload);
        database.markNodeReady(done.node);
    }

    for (DefinitionRequest& done : definitionStreamer.completed()) {
        SubtreeHandle definition = definitionCache.lookup(done.asset);
        if (!definition.valid())
            definition = definitionCache.registerLoaded(done.asset, database);

        database.mountSubtree(done.parent, definition, done.placement);
        // A stale parent simply returns an invalid placement.
    }

    database.applyUpdates(256);
}
```

Making definition nodes unavailable does not change topology. GPU eviction is
separate because one resource may be referenced by several independent nodes:

```cpp
for (NodeHandle node : readinessPolicy.nodesToDisable())
    database.markNodeUnavailable(node);

for (UserPayload payload : payloadCache.unreferencedResources())
    evictFromGpu(payload);
```

Topology can remain mounted so that later refinement calls continue to expose
future demand, or collection can remove cold leaf placements later.

## 15. End-to-end example: moving multiview scene

Use one query per logical view, move top-level cohorts in one writer phase, and
combine view usage during collection.

```cpp
SpatialDatabase::MotionGroup vehicles(vehicleInstances);
SpatialQuery mainQuery;
SpatialQuery shadowQuery;
mainQuery.setMountUsageEnabled(true);
shadowQuery.setMountUsageEnabled(true);

void frame(std::span<const float4> vehiclePositions)
{
    // Writer phase.
    database.moveInstances(vehicles, vehiclePositions, 1.0f);
    for (const AnimatedBound& edit : animatedBounds)
        database.setNodeBounds(edit.instance, edit.node, edit.localBounds);
    database.applyUpdates(256);

    // Concurrent read phase.
    FrontierResult mainResult;
    FrontierResult shadowResult;
    runConcurrently(
        [&] {
            mainQuery.selectFrontier(database, mainCamera, mainParams,
                                     mainResult);
        },
        [&] {
            shadowQuery.selectFrontier(database, shadowCamera, shadowParams,
                                       shadowResult);
        });

    render(mainResult);
    renderShadow(shadowResult);

    // Writer phase resumes after both queries finish.
    std::array<SpatialQuery*, 2> views{&mainQuery, &shadowQuery};
    database.collect(views, mountedSubtreeBudget, minimumUnusedEpochs);
}
```

Owning `FrontierResult` objects are used because the results survive past the
selection calls and are consumed together.

## 16. Handle lifetimes and current limits

All runtime handles carry generation stamps:

```cpp
if (database.isMounted(placement))
    database.unmountSubtree(placement);

if (database.isSubtree(definition))
    useDefinition(definition);
```

| Handle | Refers to | Becomes stale when |
|---|---|---|
| `SubtreeHandle` | registered immutable definition | `releaseSubtree()` |
| `SubtreeInstanceHandle` | one mounted placement | unmount, collection, or owning root removal |
| `InstanceHandle` | one permanent TLAS root | `removeInstance()` |
| `NodeHandle` | one root or mounted node | root or containing placement removal |

Current limits:

- top-level transforms support translation, positive uniform scale, and
  planar yaw; mount transforms support translation and uniform scale;
- one authored node has at most 511 local children;
- mounted placement slots and definition-local node indices use 20 bits;
- mounted-node generations use 24 bits;
- TLAS-root generations use 20 bits;
- public instance ids use 24 bits;
- rendering, IO, content lookup, and streaming policy remain application
  responsibilities.

lifetimes, and all support types, continue with
